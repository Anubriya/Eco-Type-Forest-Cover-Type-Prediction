# Eco-Type-Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction
To develop a ml classification model that predicts the type of forest cover in a geographical area using cartographic variables such as elevation, soil type, slope, and wilderness area. The aim is to assist in environmental monitoring, forestry management, and land use planning by providing automated and reliable forest cover type identification.
